### Day 18: Many-Worlds Interpretation

I didn't find the time to get this to work today. The idea is to calculate the
distance between all keys pairs and then do a recursive brute force search for
the best order for opening the locks. It seems I got some of the details wrong
still, so me answers do not come out right. Might or might not fix this later.
