### 01 - The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation/

What to say? Just do the math and recurse until done.

### 02 - 1202 Program Alarm/

What would AoC be without the obligatory elven CPU? Basic VM dispatcher
with some helper templates for instruction decoding.

### 03 - Crossed Wires/

Ha, found a use for NPeg! Trace the first wire, store all points with the
distance traveled in a sparse 2D map and check for collisions while tracing the
second wire.

### 04 - Secure Container/

Iterate over the range and split the numbers in to base 10 digits. Not
particularly fast but does the job.

### 05 - Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids/

Extension of day 2 with some extra instructions, variable length instructions
and addressing modes. I have the feeling this will not be the last we see of
this...
