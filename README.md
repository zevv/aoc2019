### Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation

What to say? Just do the math and recurse until done.

### Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm

What would AoC be without the obligatory elven CPU? Basic VM dispatcher
with some helper templates for instruction decoding.

### Day 3: Crossed Wires

Ha, found a use for NPeg! Trace the first wire, store all points with the
distance traveled in a sparse 2D map and check for collisions while tracing the
second wire.

### Day 4: Secure Container

Iterate over the range and split the numbers in to base 10 digits. Not
particularly fast but does the job.

### Day 5: Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids

Extension of day 2 with some extra instructions, variable length instructions
and addressing modes. I have the feeling this will not be the last we see of
this...

### Day 6: Universal Orbit Map

Today I learned about the `-+-` HashSet operator!

### Day 7: Amplification Circuit

Aaaand, there's the CPU again. Needs some refactoring when you need to run them
in parallel, though.

### Day 8: Space Image Format

Nim functional programming show off.

### Day 9: Sensor Boost

_You now have a complete Intcode computer_. About time.
